Only recently created at the start of 2023, Sushi Takeaway is a takeaway chain store in New Zealand. We aim to cater Kiwis with their Japanese cuisine needs. 

Due to our recent opening, the menu only has 8 food items and there are only 3 Sushi Takeaway chain stores. We aim to expand our menu and chainstore locations in the future. With your help, our patrons, our expansion may become reality. So please continue to support us!

Thank you for choosing Sushi Takeaway.
